# n8n-nodes-sevdesk-v2 Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the n8n-nodes-sevdesk-v2 project based on the requirements analysis and current codebase assessment. The project currently consists of placeholder implementations that need to be replaced with actual SevDesk API integrations to meet the production-ready goals outlined in the requirements.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- ‚úÖ Well-structured project architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive TypeScript setup with proper build configuration
- ‚úÖ Extensive resource definitions and field descriptions already implemented
- ‚úÖ Good foundation for testing with Jest and proper test utilities
- ‚úÖ Proper n8n community node structure and configuration
- ‚úÖ Clean development workflow with linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks

### Critical Gaps
- ‚ùå **All API operations are placeholder implementations** - No actual SevDesk API calls
- ‚ùå **Missing authentication implementation** - API key not being used for requests
- ‚ùå **No error handling for real API scenarios** - Only generic error handling
- ‚ùå **Missing data validation and transformation** - No input/output processing
- ‚ùå **Incomplete test coverage** - Tests don't verify actual functionality
- ‚ùå **Missing TypeScript interfaces** - No proper typing for API responses
