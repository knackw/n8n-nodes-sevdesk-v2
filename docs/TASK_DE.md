## Implementation Notes

- **CRITICAL tasks must be completed before any new features are added**
- All placeholder implementations in SevDeskResourceManager.ts need immediate attention
- The current codebase has extensive description files but lacks actual API implementation
- Focus on making the node actually functional before adding advanced features
- Each task should include acceptance criteria and testing requirements
- Regular code reviews should be conducted for all implementations
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
- Performance impact should be measured for all optimizations
- Consider the German market requirements for SevDesk integration
