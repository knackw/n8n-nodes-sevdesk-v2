# n8n-nodes-sevdesk-v2 Project Requirements

**Version:** 2.4.1  
**Updated:** 2025-07-14  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**API Compatibility:** SevDesk API v2.0

## Project Overview

This document outlines the key requirements, goals, and constraints for the n8n-nodes-sevdesk-v2 project - a community node for integrating n8n workflows with the SevDesk v2 API.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Core Functionality

- **Complete SevDesk API v2 Integration**: Provide full access to SevDesk's accounting API capabilities

- **Production-Ready Implementation**: Deliver a stable, reliable node suitable for business-critical workflows
- **German Market Focus**: Optimize for German accounting standards and business practices

### 2. User Experience

- **Simplified Configuration**: Require only API key and version selection for setup
- **Comprehensive Resource Support**: Cover all major SevDesk entities (contacts, invoices, vouchers, etc.)
- **Intuitive Operation**: Provide clear, logical operation flows for common accounting tasks
- **Robust Error Handling**: Deliver meaningful error messages and graceful failure handling

### 3. Developer Experience

- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain well-structured, maintainable codebase
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for comprehensive type checking
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Achieve high test coverage with reliable test suites
- **Clear Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation for users and contributors

## Technical Requirements

### 1. API Integration

- **SevDesk API v2 Compatibility**: Full support for the latest SevDesk API version
- **Authentication**: Secure API key-based authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect SevDesk API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all API scenarios
- **Response Transformation**: Proper data transformation between SevDesk API and n8n formats

### 2. Supported Resources

- **Core Resources** (Must Have):

  - Contacts (customers, suppliers)
  - Invoices (creation, management, PDF generation)
  - Vouchers (document management)
  - Orders (order lifecycle management)
  - Parts (inventory management)
  - Check Accounts (banking integration)
  - Tags (flexible categorization)
  - Reports (PDF generation)

- **Extended Resources** (Should Have):
  - Credit Notes
  - Exports
  - Communication Ways
  - Categories
  - Units

### 3. Operations Support

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete for all supported resources
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple items
- **Advanced Filtering**: Comprehensive search and filter capabilities
- **File Operations**: Upload and download of documents/attachments
- **Pagination**: Proper handling of large datasets

### 4. Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout the codebase
- **ESLint Compliance**: Adherence to n8n community node standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- **Performance**: Efficient resource usage and response times

## Constraints

### 1. Technical Constraints

- **n8n Compatibility**: Must work with n8n's node architecture and APIs
- **Node.js Version**: Support Node.js >= 18.0.0
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies (currently only axios and dotenv)
- **Bundle Size**: Keep the compiled node size reasonable for distribution

### 2. API Constraints

- **SevDesk Rate Limits**: Respect API rate limiting (varies by plan)
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication only
- **Data Formats**: Work within SevDesk's data structure requirements
- **German Compliance**: Adhere to German accounting and tax regulations

### 3. Development Constraints

- **Community Node Standards**: Follow n8n community node development guidelines
- **MIT License**: Maintain open-source MIT licensing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing workflows where possible
